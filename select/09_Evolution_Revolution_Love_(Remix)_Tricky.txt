Tricky:
Now that you got it right
Bring love and itll make it alright
Bring love and well take it tonite
Now that you got it right
Who wants the sinner
Coming round for dinner
Who needs effects
Who needs to pay for sex
When they drop the bomb?
Who will stay calm
Blood would spill
Who would you kill?

Hawkman:
Walking down the street with my little rude gun
Top of my gun pocket for fun
Block on my tongue
Top of my earth
Tip of my birth
Top of my earth
Tip of my breast
Top of my chest
Tip of my guess
Ive got the singles
I got the jingles
Bet you eat pringles with chris kringles
Walking on the road with my little rude gun

Hawkman:
She was born in the ghetto
Outside the bronx
In a project blocks
Where time stands still
It dont tick it dont tock
Top of my sun
Keep all my love
Top of my chest
Tip of my breast
Top of my earth
Walking on the road
With my soul in my hand
Tip on my toes
Top of my span
